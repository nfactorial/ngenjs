NGEN.JS
=======
A simple example using ngen.js (still being worked on) can be seen
at http://nfactorial.io/game.html (EDSF to move, hold left mouse button
to rotate camera).

This project is mostly for research using JavaScript and WebGL.
It's not intended as a widely usable framework, just something for me
to try out ideas with.
